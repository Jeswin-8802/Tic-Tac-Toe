# Tic-Tac-Toe
 The classic Tic Tac Toe game written in JavaScript

## For those of you completely new to Tic Tac Toe
 Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game in which the players fill up nine empty rectangles in a table with either an `X` or an `O` when it is their turn. Once someone succeeds to line up their sign vertically or horizontally without an interruption, that player wins.
 
### *How to Play*
 Click anywhere on the `3 x 3` grid to start playing to set the cell in that grid to either `X` or `O`. The game end when the conditions given above are reached.
 
 There is a multiplayer option as well as an option to play against the computer (I bet you will find it very difficult to win against it).

 I tried to make the game a little different from how it usually is by adding a `4 x 4` version of it.
